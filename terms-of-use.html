                        <p>Welcome to NamsoGen! By accessing or using our website and associated tools (collectively, the "Service"), you signify your agreement to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>
                        
                        <h2>1. Service Description and Purpose</h2>
                        <p>NamsoGen provides online utilities primarily aimed at software developers, testers, and security professionals. Key features include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Credit Card Number Generator:</strong> Creates algorithmically generated, structurally valid (Luhn-compliant), but entirely **fictional and non-functional** credit card numbers.</li>
                            <li><strong>BIN Lookup:</strong> Retrieves publicly available, non-sensitive information related to a Bank Identification Number (BIN) using a third-party data source.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>IMPORTANT: The Service is strictly intended for lawful educational, development, testing, and security research purposes only. It is NOT designed for, and MUST NOT be used for, any financial transactions or fraudulent activities.</strong></p>

                        <h2>2. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
                        <p>Your use of the Service is conditional upon your adherence to this Acceptable Use Policy. You explicitly agree NOT to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fraudulent Use:</strong> Attempt to use any generated credit card number for actual purchases, validation on live payment systems, or any form of financial fraud. This is illegal and strictly prohibited.</li>
                            <li><strong>Illegal Activities:</strong> Use the Service in connection with any activity that violates applicable local, state, national, or international laws or regulations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Harvesting/Scraping:</strong> Employ automated scripts, bots, or other means to systematically extract data from the Service (including BIN lookup results) beyond reasonable manual use for testing.</li>
                            <li><strong>System Abuse:</strong> Engage in any activity that could disrupt, overburden, damage, or impair the functioning of the Service or its underlying infrastructure (e.g., denial-of-service attacks).</li>
                            <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> Falsely represent the generated numbers as real, active credit cards or misuse the BIN lookup data.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We reserve the right to investigate potential violations and take appropriate action, including suspending or terminating access to the Service, and reporting illegal activities to law enforcement authorities.</p>

                        <h2>3. Disclaimers and Limitation of Warranties</h2>
                         <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
                         <ul>
                             <li><strong>Generated Numbers are FAKE:</strong> We explicitly state that generated numbers are algorithmically created, have no real financial backing, and WILL NOT WORK for any real transaction.</li>
                             <li><strong>BIN Data Accuracy:</strong> The BIN lookup feature relies on third-party data sources. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of this information. It should be used as a reference only.</li>
                             <li><strong>No Guarantee of Uptime:</strong> We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Service.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>Your reliance on any information or tool provided by the Service is solely at your own risk.</p>

                        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                         </ul>
                        <p>This limitation applies whether the alleged liability is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>
